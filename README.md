ðŸ”…Create an ansible role myapache to configure Httpd WebServer.

ðŸ”…Create another ansible role myloadbalancer to configure HAProxy LB.

ðŸ”…Combine both of these roles controlling webserver versions

and solving challenge for host ip's addition dynamically over each ManagedNode in **HAProxy.cfg** file.

Create a working space for all the required files and roles

**Note : All commands are for RHEL8 Linux OS.**
```
mkdir /ws_task_15/
```

Prior to all the sub-tasks we need to declare **Role** in **ansible configuration file** 
> /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg  


##### **Sub-Task 1** : Create an ansible role myapache to configure Httpd WebServer.

**Step 1** : create a role "webserver".
```
ansible-galaxy role init webserver
```

**Step 2**: goto vars file in the role and declare the variables that we have to use in the playbook.


**Step 3** : then goto tasks file and write the code(tasks) in main.yml


**step 4** : goto files and paste the webpages that we need to deploy here


##### **Sub-Task 2** : Create another ansible role to configure HAProxy LB.

**Step 1**: create another role "haproxy" inside the same working space
```
ansible-galaxy role init haproxy
```

**Step 2** : goto vars directory and declare all the variables that we need in playbook


**Step 3** : Now goto tasks directory write down the code and "host name" in main.yml file


**Step 4** : goto templates directory and paste the "configured" haproxy configuration file.



##### **Sub-Task 3** : We need to combine both of these roles controlling webserver versions and solving challenge for host ip's addition dynamically over each Managed Node in HAProxy.cfg file."

**Step 1**: create a simple ansible-playbook (YML file) and call both the roles and the hosts.


**Step 2**: execute the playbook.

if the playbook executes successfully then

- The httpd service is running at the webserver(managed node) end.
- haproxy.cfg file at the server end will acquire the server IP dynamically.
- Webserver is Up and Active.
